            Our Founder, Scott Robertson, is a native Texan who grew up in
            Richardson and raised his 6 kids in McKinney. Over the last 30
            years, he has successfully managed multiple services companies,
            specializing in Janitorial, Carpet and floor restoration and
            maintenance, fire and flood restoration, and small building facility
            maintenance. Throughout his career, Scott has amassed tremendous
            experience and has built strong relationships with some of the most
            talented technicians in their respective industries. It has become
            apparent to him that smaller businesses and facilities often
            struggle to find reliable and outstanding cleaning and maintenance
            solutions.
